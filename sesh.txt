Experimental guide.
Steps for running simulations:

- Launch a Ganache Blockchain
- Copy address[0] to truffle-config.js
- Create IPFS daemon | ipfs daemon
- Deploy contract | truffle migrate --network development
- Copy contract address to: setup, node1, node2, node3, aggregator, node1_receiver
- Run setup script | python setup.py
- Run node scripts | python node1.py, python node2.py, python node3.py
- Run aggregator script | python aggregator.py
- Run receiver script | python node1_receiver.py
